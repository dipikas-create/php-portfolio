        <p>
            I am a PHP Web Developer with professional experience in web development
            and technical training. I have worked on PHP-based projects involving
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL.
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy building clean, structured, and user-friendly websites.
            Currently, I am focusing on refreshing my development skills
            and working on hands-on projects to re-enter the IT industry.
